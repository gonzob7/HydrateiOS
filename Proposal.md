# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Gonzo Birrueta** 


**Project Name: Hydrate** 


**Is your project New or Old?: New**


**Is your project Solo or Team?: Solo**


## Description

Hydrate is an iOS application designed to help you stay hydrated. According to a recent study, half of americans are not drinking enough water which could impact us both physically and mentally. The main purpose of this app is to help users keep track of their daily water intake, and set goals to eventually be intaking a healthy amount of water. The app will remind you when you are falling behind on the daily goal, and also congratualate you when you're on track to meeting your goal. The app will even try to motivate you by reminding you of the endless benefits of staying hydrated.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**Some challenges I anticipate are making the user expierence as smooth as possible, as well as connecting the app's data to the native Health app**

## Skateboard

- Ability to create a profile with your specific info (gender, age, weight, activities, etc) and use that information to create your daily intake goals.

## Bike

- Ability to log and keep track of daily water intake.

## Car

- Link everything with Health app, give notifications.

## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Learn about what effects our personalized recommened water intake, and apply it to the app.
2. Have a delightful UI/UX
3. Learn and apply HealthKit API
